Script to sort pictures from different cameras by timestamp, using the EXIF
information from the pictures. This is the first half of the script.

To use:
 - make a root folder, with no pictures
 - make one subfolder for each camera, with all its pictures
When you execute this script, it creates a list of pictures with its
timestamp (DateTimeOriginal) in the root folder and a playlist to see the
order in which the pictures will be sorted.

The playlist can be seen with, for example, the following command line:
$feh --full-screen --auto-zoom --quiet --hide-pointer --filelist playlist.txt
or any other program that allows a playlist of pictures.

After verifying that the order is fine, execute the second part of the script.
If the order is wrong, make a "delay.txt" file in each desired subfolder with
the timeshift of the camera (format is yyyy:MM:dd hh:mm:ss). This time will be
added to all pictures in that subfolder.

Known bugs: I _think_ that negative delays can't be used
